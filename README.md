# Google Play Store Apps Analysis ðŸ“±
## Oasisinfobyte Data Analytics Internship - Task

### Project Overview
This project analyzes Google Play Store app data to uncover insights about the Android app market. The analysis includes app categories, ratings, pricing trends, and user sentiment analysis from reviews.

### Dataset
The analysis uses two primary datasets:
- `apps.csv`: Contains information about various apps including category, rating, size, and price
- `user_reviews.csv`: Contains user reviews and sentiment data

### Key Features
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Data type corrections
   - Standardizing formats

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Category distribution analysis
   - Price analysis across categories
   - Rating trends investigation
   - App size distribution

3. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - User review analysis
   - Sentiment scoring
   - Category-wise sentiment patterns

4. **Visualization**
   - Interactive charts and graphs
   - Category-wise distributions
   - Correlation analysis visualizations
